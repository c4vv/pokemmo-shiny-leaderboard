# shiny-leaderboard

A leaderboard for Shiny Hunter teams and players in PokeMMO.

## Overview

The PokeMMO Shiny OT Leaderboard is a community-driven project that ranks teams and individual players based on their shiny Pok√©mon achievements. Only OT (Original Trainer) shinies are counted, meaning these are shinies the players have caught themselves and still possess.

## Features

- **Team Leaderboard:** Ranks teams based on the total number of OT shinies.
- **Player Leaderboard:** Ranks individual players based on the total number of OT shinies.
- **Daily Updates:** The shiny counts are updated daily from publicly available information on PokeMMO.
- **Data Scraping:** JSON files are generated from web scrapers that read the team showcases.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection:** The data is sourced from JSON files located in the `teams` and `users` directories. Each file contains information about a team's or player's name, URL, and total number of OT shinies.
2. **Data Scraping:** Web scrapers read the team showcases on PokeMMO to gather the necessary data. The `cron` folder contains the web scrapers that generate the JSON files.
3. **Daily Updates:** The data is updated on a daily basis to ensure the leaderboard reflects the most current and accurate information.
